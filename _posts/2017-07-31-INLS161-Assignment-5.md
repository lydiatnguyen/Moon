For our final assignment for INLS161, we were tasked with making a "well-formed" presentation using <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/" target="_blank">reveal.js</a>.

Like many of you reading this, I also had no idea reveal.js existed. It is basically another platform where one can create a presentation slideshow using HTML.

I never really liked using PowerPoint and would often opt for Prezi instead.
Check out one of my Prezi's <a href="http://prezi.com/lcmicvc6y9t6/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share" target="_blank">here!</a>

We were given the directions that this powerpoint could be on anything.
Indecisive me was very shocked but excited at these directions. What is a presentation I could create that would be a topic that could sustain my interest and also be somewhat awakening for my peers?

I chose to make a presentation on capitalism and advertising. I wanted to get gears turning and produce something I could show to my friends to talk about. (but really, one of my closest friends and I send good morning texts that say things like "Class consciousness got you down today? :(" )

I got to mess around a lot with HTML and reveal.js settings.

I really like reveal.js. I think it's really cool to use and has functions that are useful like vertical slides and speaker notes. 
I am grateful to have been introduced to it because I will definitely be using it again.

I'd like to give music credit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXoRoLdXnvU" target="_blank">Marteria</a>, one of my favourite German music artists that keeps me questioning our world.

His tracks Roswell and Aliens were used in this for educational reasons ;) dankesch√∂n, Marteria!

The video footage is from a music video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVagGGIsqtI" target="_blank">Astronaut</a> by Sido and Andreas Bourani.

I'd also like to thank John!! and Friedrich Nietzsche for "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", which kept me going throughout the end of the semester.I

For more music like his, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKftOH54iNU" target="_blank">Stromae</a>.
