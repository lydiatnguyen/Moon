BLOG POST DRAFT

For our final assignment for INLS161, we were tasked with making a "well-formed" presentation using reveal.js

Like many of you reading this, I also had no idea reveal.js existed. It is basically another platform where one can create a presentation slideshow using HTML.

I never really liked using PowerPoint and would often opt for Prezi instead.
Check out one of my Prezi's here!

We were given the directions that this powerpoint could be on anything.
Indecisive me was very shocked but excited at these directions. What is a presentation I could create that would be a topic that could sustain my interest and also be somewhat awakening for my peers?

I chose to make a presentation on neoliberal capitalism and its effects on our world today.

I got to mess around a lot with HTML and reveal.js settings.

I really like reveal.js and am grateful to have been introduced to it because I will be using it again.

Here is a link to my presentation: _insert link_
