There are a few key moments in my life that I remember clearly changing the way I thought about the world. 
Key moment one was in my pre-calculus class in high school, when I learned that angles can be measured not only in degrees but also radians. 
Key moment two was when I realized nowhere= now+here.
Key moment three was when I realized things within your Google Drive are not necessarily private. My brainstorming, life dreams, and private files...could be used by Google?
Key moment four was when one of my first scripts ran and converted a markdown file to a PDF. Thank you INLS161 and John.

For Assignment 3...
