Hallo!
This is my first post for INLS161. 
This is going to be a post all about one of my favourite cities in the world - Berlin, Germany.
A way for my to practice some web design techniques...

I studied abroad in Berlin in the spring of 2016.
It more than changed my life. 

I came to love trains and street art even more. Everyday, I would wait for the bahn (train) and admire all the graffiti and street art all around.

My favourite part of traveling is noticing the diasporic communities. There are many Turkish people in Berlin. 
Döner is a Turkish food that made its way to becoming a popular street food in Berlin and all around Germany.
Ich liebe Döner.

Here is a video from one of my favourite German music groups, Berge. The video shows different parts of Berlin.
