###INLS161 Assignment 3 - Text Conversion

There are a few key moments in my life that I remember clearly changing the way I thought about the world. 
A few of these moments include:
1. In my pre-calculus class in high school, when I learned that angles can be measured not only in degrees but also radians 
2. When I realized nowhere= now+here
3. When I realized things within your Google Drive are not necessarily private. My brainstorming, life dreams, and private files...could be used by Google?
**4. When one of my first scripts ran and converted a markdown file to a PDF. Thank you INLS161 and John.**

For Assignment 3, I created a markdown version of a country profile description I wrote in one of my beginner German language courses here at UNC.
It is written in beginner level German and is all about **Poland**.

Here is an image showing where Poland is in the world for those that are not so geographically inclined:
![Poland](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/15/bc/95/15bc9533ec0c60be2ec8eb5650e284ea--where-is-poland-maps.jpg "Where is Poland")

Now that you have learned where Poland is in the world, you can read my file in all its glory! -and  all of its file types!
I wrote a script and used Pandoc, a document converter, to convert the [initial Markdown file](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.md) into:

* [HTML](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.html)
* [Docx](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.docx)
* [ODT](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.odt)
* [PDF](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.pdf)
* [TXT](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/polen.txt)

Personally, my favourite is the PDF. It made me really excited to see the Markdown transform into a clean PDF.
To see the script I wrote to make this work, you can click [here](https://github.com/lydiatnguyen/lydiatnguyen-convert-documents/blob/master/lydiatnguyen-convert-docs.sh)

The script included applying my knowledge of variables, input and output files, pandoc commands, and echo.
It was admittedly confusing at first for me to understand all this(baby's first script), but I am proud to say I understand it clearer after having done this assignment. 

If you are looking for a way to convert your file to different file types, [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is your friend!
